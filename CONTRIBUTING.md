# Adding Mods to the Listing

Mods will be added to the listing automatically if your 
mod is found by GitHub while searching for `mindustry-mod`.
Currently the project is in developement, and so things aren't
being updated as they should. You can put your icon at
`icon.png` *(at the root of your project)* in your repository,
and it'll get picked up automatically.
